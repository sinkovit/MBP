(1) Combine f1() through f223 into a single function

(2) Split poly-3b-v2x.cpp into multiple parts

top.cpp    - everything through definition of f1()
bodyf1.cpp - version 1 body of function f1()
mid.cpp    - closing brace of f1() and start of poly_3b_v2x()
bodyp1.cpp - version 1 body of poly_3b_v2x()
tail.cpp   - remainder of poly_3b_v2x()

Original file can be reconstructed as follows

cat top.cpp bodyf1.cpp mid.cpp bodyp1.cpp tail.cpp > poly-3b-v2x-1.cpp
