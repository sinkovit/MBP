(1) Combine f1() through f223 into a single function

(2) Split poly-3b-v2x.cpp into three parts: head.ccp, body.cpp, tail.cpp

* head.ccp contains everything through the definition of f1()

* body.cpp is the calculation of array t

* tail.cpp is closing brace of f1() through end of file

The complete file can be reconstituted by concatenating the three files

cat head.cpp body.cpp tail.cpp > poly-3b-v2x.cpp
