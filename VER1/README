(1) Combine f1() through f223() and poly_3b_v2x() into a single function

(2) Split poly-3b-v2x.cpp into multiple parts

top.cpp    - everything through definition of f1()
bodyp1.cpp - version 1 body of poly_3b_v2x()
tail.cpp   - remainder of poly_3b_v2x()

Original file can be reconstructed as follows

cat top.cpp bodyp1.cpp tail.cpp > poly-3b-v2x-1.cpp
