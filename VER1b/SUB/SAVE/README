Original code:
poly-3b-v2x-1b-orig.cpp

***
Elements of t[] renumbered to eliminate gaps
poly-3b-v2x-1b-000.cpp

***
Identify pairs of elements of t[] that always appear together, combine
into a single element and use throughout remainder of the code. Done
incrementally so that we can always go back to a last working version.

poly-3b-v2x-1b-001.cpp
...
poly-3b-v2x-1b-078.cpp

***
Building on previous step, simplify calculations in combined terms
since -O2 optimization may keep original order of math operations
