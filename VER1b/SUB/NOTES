(1) Combine math operations that may not be optimized using -O2

For example, this ...

t[20424] = t[2296] * t[68] + t[2296] * t[88]

... becomes ...

t[20424] = t[2296] * (t[68] + t[88])

(2) Pull all assignments of the form "t[n] = a[m]" into a single function that is only executed once. Can save 1163 assignments.

(3) Renumbering of elements of t matrix after finishing substitutions

(4) Look for pairs of elements of t that are used with stride 2
